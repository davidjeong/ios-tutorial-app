# ios-tutorial-app
This is an iOS mobile application for making lists, which I used as a tutorial to prepare myself for the FYDP. 

I used the Roadmap To iOS Development, found at this link (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/). As extra practice, I added a feature to delete the item from list by swiping the item.  

*The FYDP application will be hosted on BitBucket due to free private repository.
